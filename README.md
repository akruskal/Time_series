## Marks and comments

| Question | Mark           | Comment       	|
|----------|----------------|---------------	|
| 1.       |  9/10           |  Good, however it is good practice to set your own y-axis limits appropriate to the data.            	|
| 2.       |  15/15           |   Nice answer!              |
| 3.       |  1/10           |   The best way to test for autocorrelation is the ACF/PACF plots and the Durbin-Waton test. Also, you have not explained the reason to check for and adjust for autocorrelation (b/c independence of residuals is an assumption of linear regression).  	          |
| 4.       |  13/15           |  Good, except that the lagged bll variable is to control for autocorrelation. 	            |
| 5.       |  20/25           | Nice answer - another advantage of Model 3 is that it adjusts for seasonality that you identified in Q2. Also, while you have check the model fit (e.g. residual plots) you should also comment on the fit of your chosen model.                  |
| 6.       |  8/15           | You should calculate 95% CIs for all main effect estimates (baseline trend, level shift and slope change). A few other comments - make sure it is clear that the baseline trend is monthly. Also your interpretation of the slope change could be explained a bit better.      	          |
| 7.       |  10/10           |   Great!   	          |
| Overall  |  76/100          |  Nice work               |
|Overall minus late penalty| 72.2/100|1-day late: 76*(1-.05*1)|
